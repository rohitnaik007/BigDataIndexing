# BigDataIndexing

Developed a REST application using Springboot and implemented CRUD functionalities to store JSON data on redis.
Secured the REST API using Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol.
Used Apache Kafka backed by Zookeeper as a queuing service to publish messages asynchronously.
Created a consumer application to consume messages on the Kafka topic and index the data to Elasticsearch. Used Kibana to visualize the data and to query Elasticsearch.
